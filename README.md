## Description of my Project:

This application is a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL

## Usage Story

As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business

## Installation Instructions:

![Database Schema](Assets/schema.png)

1. You will need to update your .env file.
2. Run NPM Install
3. run seeds/index.js to seed your database.
4. Run nodemon server.js

## Usage Information:

1. Use the MySQL NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

2. Use InquirerJs NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

3. Use console.table to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of console.table, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

4. You may wish to have a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a constructor function or a class be helpful for organizing these?

5. You will need to perform a variety of SQL JOINS to complete this assignment, and it's recommended you review the week's activities if you need a refresher on this.
